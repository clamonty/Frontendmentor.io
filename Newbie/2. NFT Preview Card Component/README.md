## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I always struggle with adding background image overlays on hover, so figuring this one out without any googling was nice. I would up making the background-color of an image container div the primary cyan, and changing the opacity of the eye icon and image when I hovered. 

Also I remembered the box shadow this time!
